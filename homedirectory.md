Yes, in an **IBM MQ RDQM (Replicated Data Queue Manager)** configuration, the home directory of the **`mqm` user** must be set to **`/var/mqm`**. This is a requirement for RDQM to function correctly.

### Reasons:
1. **RDQM Setup**: RDQM relies on specific directories and file structures under `/var/mqm` for storing queue manager data, configuration files, and logs. The replication process and high availability features use these directories to manage data between nodes.
  
2. **Consistency**: Setting the `mqm` user’s home directory to `/var/mqm` ensures that all relevant MQ data, including those related to RDQM operations, is located in a consistent location across all nodes in the replication setup.

3. **Permissions and Access**: The `mqm` user is granted specific permissions to manage the directories and files under `/var/mqm`. This is where all queue managers and RDQM replication data are stored, and RDQM requires that these files be accessible by the `mqm` user during operations like queue manager creation, start, stop, and replication.

### Key Considerations:
- During RDQM setup and installation, it’s important to ensure that the `mqm` user’s home directory is **correctly set to `/var/mqm`**.
- If the home directory of the `mqm` user is set elsewhere, RDQM will likely fail to function correctly, potentially leading to errors during queue manager replication, management, or failover processes.

In summary, for IBM MQ RDQM configurations, the home directory of the `mqm` user must indeed be `/var/mqm` to ensure proper operation of the RDQM system.
